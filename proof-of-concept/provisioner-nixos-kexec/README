Contained is a proof of concept implementation of the nixos-kexec
provisioner. It is hard-coded to my SSH key, uses a shady URL for
the kexec tarball, and doesn't support custom formatting or anything.
However, the bones are here:

1. It takes a given Linux install and replaces it with a kexec
   (convert-to-nixos.sh, lines 14-19)
2. It then runs what-could-be-arbitrary bash (install-snippet, lines
   3-7) to format and mount disks, and runs the NixOS config generator
3. Places an SSH key (install-snippet, line 10)
4. Install NixOS and reboots (install-snippet 22-23)

In terms of README.org:

> When the provisioner finishes, the instance will be:
 - DONE: Running a stock NixOS configuration
 - DONE: Usable SSH and firewall settings
 - DONE: A public SSH key used by the controlling NixOps deploy host
   trusted by the system
 - DONE: An appropriately generated hardware-configuration.nix on the host.

Not done: the longer term custom config generation code
